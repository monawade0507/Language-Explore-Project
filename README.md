# Language-Explore-Project
Programming Langauges (CSCI_400): Lanaguage (Objective-C) Explore Project


## Programs

Programs should provide a demonstration of the languages features, or potentially something it’s pretty good for. For example, if you were exploring a Lisp-like language [2], you may want to write a program demonstrating symbolic computation, as Lisp is particularly good for this. As another example, if your language is really good at concurrency, you’ll definitely want to write an program which makes good use of concurrency.

I expect two to three programs of reasonable size in your submission. I’m not looking for small code snippets, but decently sized programs; think approximately the complexity of a CSCI-262 project.

Make sure to include in a comment at the top of each program with who wrote the program. If you pair programmed or the whole group contributed, make a note of that. It’s OK if programs are completed individually, I just expect that everyone in your group will have written at least one program in total.
